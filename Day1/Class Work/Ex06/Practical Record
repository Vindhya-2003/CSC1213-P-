Problem Specification:Type conversion in Java

Implementation:
class Exercise
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		char cl='g';
		System.out.println("The character is :"+cl);
		
		int int1=(int)cl;
		System.out.println("The character is :"+int1);
		
	double dl=10.09;
	System.out.println("The value is :"+dl);
	
	int int2=(int)dl;
	System.out.println("The value is :"+int2);
	
	double d2=int1;
	System.out.println("The value is :"+d2);
	}
}
Output:
The character is :g
The character is :103
The value is :10.09
The value is :10
The value is :103.0

Conclution: The Programm demostrates type conversion in java between char, int and double
